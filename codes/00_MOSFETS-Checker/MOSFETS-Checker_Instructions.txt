MOSFET Checker Procedure:

1. Construct the circuit according to the schematic presented in scheme.jpg.
2. Utilize the Arduino IDE to upload the file mosfet-checker-ino/mosfet-checker-ino.ino.
3. Connect the MOSFET for evaluation.
4. Apply approximately 5 V to power the circuit.
5. Commence data acquisition by executing capture_and_grapher/capture-datos.py. Edit the script to reflect the correct serial USB port on the computer assigned to the perovskite jig, if needed.
6. Generate graphs based on the collected data using capture_and_grapher/grapher2.py.
