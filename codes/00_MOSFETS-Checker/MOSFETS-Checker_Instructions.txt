MOSFET Checker Procedure:

To verify that selected MOSFET works ok.
 
1. Construct the circuit according to the schematic presented in Figure.png or attach a single Si-cell under ~ 1 Sun illumination.
2. Utilize the Arduino IDE to upload the file mosfet-checker-ino/mosfet-checker-ino.ino.
3. Connect the MOSFET for evaluation.
4. Apply approximately 5 V to power the circuit or illuminate the cell under 1 Sun.
5. Commence data acquisition by executing capture_and_grapher/capture-datos.py. Edit the script to reflect the correct serial USB port on the computer assigned to the perovskite jig if needed.
6. Generate graphs based on the collected data using capture_and_grapher/grapher2.py.
7. Repeat the process using Si-cell under 0.1 Sun to find the correct DAC integer range to be applied in the VGATE.
8. Select the DAC interval and generate the VGATE list for SOP or PO MPP scripts using generate_dac_lists4SOP.py or generate_dac_lists4PO.py, respectively.


Notes:

Examples of broken ILZN43N MOSFETS can be found dataraw folder.
Hint: A working MOSFET shows a smooth JV curve for Si-cell under 1 Sun without spikes.
