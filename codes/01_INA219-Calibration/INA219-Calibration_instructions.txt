Procedure for INA219 Calibration (Voltage and Current Measurement):

1. Assemble the complete Perovskino jig and connect a Silicon cell or other stable cell.
2. Position the multimeter appropriately with respect to the solar cell for either voltage (parallel) or current (series) calibration measurements.
3. Employ the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to upload the file "INA219-calibration-ino.ino" in the Perovskino. Modify this file based on the voltage or current calibration requirements assuring that correcV and correcI parameters are 0 and 1, respectively

4. Initiate data acquisition by executing the "capture-datos-INA219_calibration.py" script.
5. Data visualization can be performed using scripts of the "grapher" type.

6. For current calibration, set the MCP4725 to a voltage higher than the threshold voltage of the MOSFET to induce a short circuit condition in the solar cell.
7. Adjust irradiation levels while recording the current values from both the multimeter and INA219.
8. Calculate the correct current parameter (correcI) as the slope derived from linearly fitting the multimeter and INA219 data. Refer to the "calc INA219_calibration.ods" file for an example.

9. For voltage calibration, configure the MCP4725 to a voltage below the threshold voltage of the MOSFET to achieve an open circuit condition in the solar cell.
10. Vary irradiation while noting the voltage values from both the multimeter and INA219.
11. Determine the correct voltage parameter (correcV) as the ordinate at the origin from linearly fitting the multimeter and INA219 data, using a line equation with a slope of 1. Refer to the "calc INA219_calibration.ods" file for an example.
