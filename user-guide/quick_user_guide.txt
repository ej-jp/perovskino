====== quick user guide ======

perovskino is a work in progress, please be patient.


1. install python 3x (recommended anaconda) and dependencies (pandas, matplotlib, pyserial) on your computer
2. plug perovskino to the usb of the computer
3. find the address/port assigned to the perovskino (on linux, most probably /dev/ttyUSB0) and modify the ~/codes/02_MPP-algorithms/capture_and_grapher file accordingly
4. in the ~/codes/02_MPP-algorithms/capture_and_grapher folder run "python capture-data-mpp-temperature.py".
5. The serial data is displayed on the terminal and is also stored inside the dataraw folder as csv files named date-time.csv.
6. use your favorite graphing program or grapherX.py scripts.  






tips: an easy way to find the serial address of the arduino on the computer is to install the Arduino IDE (which you will use to reprogram the arduino) and check tools/port.
